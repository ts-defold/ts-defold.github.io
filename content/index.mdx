## Why TypeScript? :sparkles:

Defold uses Lua for its game scripting language, and it is an excellent choice!
The ***ts-defold*** team loves Lua, and has worked with Lua for years. So why TypeScript?

TypeScript brings compile-time type-checking, generics, cutting-edge IDE support, 
better code maintainability, a familiar syntax, and a lot of other cool features. 
After spending 12+ years in the game industry, we have learned that the more errors 
and potential problems you can detect at compile-time over runtime, the faster you can iterate. 
As your project grows, TypeScript will pay off in spades.

Through the hard work of the [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io) project, 
we have created a toolkit that generates reliable, trusted Lua code from TypeScript code for 
your Defold game project. This means that you can reason about the generated code 
with human eyes :eyes:, know that there is a greater community supporting the transpiler, 
and trust the 100s of tests that execute on the _TSTL_ codebase.
