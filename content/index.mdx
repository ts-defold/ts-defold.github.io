## Why TypeScript? :sparkles:

Defold uses lua for its game scripting language, and it is an excellent choice!
The ts-defold team loves lua, and has worked with lua for years. So why TypeScript?

TypeScript brings compiled time type checking, generics, a familar syntax, and a 
lot of other cool features. After spending 12+ years in the game industry, we have 
learned that the more errors and potential problems you can detect at compile time 
over runtime, the faster you can iterate. As your project grows TypeScript will 
pay off in spades.

Through the hard work of the [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io) project, 
we have created a toolkit that generates reliable trusted lua code from TypeScript code for 
your Defold game project. This means that you can reason about the generated code 
with human eyes :eyes:, know that there is a greater community supporting the transpiler, 
and trust the 100s of tests that execute on the _TSTL_ codebase.

## Roadmap :construction_worker:
