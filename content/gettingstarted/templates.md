## Template Repositories

Templates are repositories hosted on github that are pre-configured to provide a 
turnkey setup experience.

## Default Template
The [default template](https://github.com/ts-defold/tsd-template) is the genesis 
template that all other templates derive from. It provides the initial project setup, 
configuration files, patches, and plugins required to start a new ***ts-defold*** project.

## Template Development & Discovery
Current templates use the [ts-defold-template](https://github.com/topics/ts-defold-template) 
topic on github and the repo names adhere to the pattern `tsd-template-*` for easier 
discovery.

If you are creating your own template, you must name it `tsd-template-*` 
where `*` is the shortname of the template. It is recommended that you also add 
the `ts-defold-template` topic to your repository.
