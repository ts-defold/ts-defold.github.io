Thanks for your interest in ***ts-defold***! There are a lot of moving parts that make everything tick, so if you are interested in the fine details, continue on!
## On the Shoulders of Giants

***ts-defold*** is built on NodeJS, _npm_, and [TypeScriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io).

Familiarity with NodeJS and _npm_ is encouraged, though not required.

## First Steps

It is recommended that you go through the [Quick Start](/gettingstarted/quickstart) and [Project Generator](/gettingstarted/cli) docs first, then find your way into the depths :hole: of the project configuration.
